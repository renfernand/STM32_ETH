# STM32_ETH
Basic Program with NUCLEO-H7223ZG using FreeRTOS and Ethernet
This program is based in FRERTOS an LWIP from the CubeIDE platform.
But The wizard from the cubeIDE cannot answer the ethernet with a wrong way.
Then This program only open a conection (like a server tcp/ip using port 8080). 
The program answer a ping and tcp/ip only.
how can I create this:
Using de CubeIDE I created a basic program enabling FRERTOS and LWIP.
Then I need to enable de cache from FreeRTOS.
